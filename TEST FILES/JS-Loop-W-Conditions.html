### Instructions

* Starting from scratch, write code that loops through the following array and logs the name of each animal on the farm to the console:

```
var myFarm = ["chickens", "pigs", "cows", "horses", "ostriches"];
```

* Then check if the first letter in the animal's name begins with a "c" or "o". If it does, create an alert saying, "Starts with 'c' or 'o'!"

* **HINT:** You can access the first character of a string as if it were the first element of an array.

    <script type="text/javascript">



var myFarm = ["chickens", "pigs", "cows", "horses", "ostriches"];
var arrayLenght = myFarm.length

for (var i = 0; i < arrayLenght; i++) {
  console.log(myFarm[i]);

  // we need an If Statement to add the condition
  // myFarm[i] will reference the loop
  // charAt is a method syntax (0) is the index for the first letter
  // console.log(myFarm[i].charAt(0)); to see first letters

// if myloop.firstletter === c or === o
    //alert me saying ""Starts with a c or am o"" 
   if (myFarm[i].charAt(0) === "c" || myFarm[i].charAt(0) === "o") {
    alert("Starts with a c or am o");
  }

}
